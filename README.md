# bank-term-deposit


Owing to revenue decline in a Bank, the root cause was found out to be customers not investing enough
for long term deposits.

So the bank would like to identify existing customers that have a higher chance to subscribe for a long
term deposit and focus marketing efforts on such customers.

The data is related to direct marketing campaigns of the banking institution. The marketing campaigns
were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to
access if the product (bank term deposit) would be subscribed or not subscribed.

The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).
